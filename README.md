# SEYI_2018
This is a repository for Stanford Earth Young Interns over the duration of summer 2018.

Over the course of the internship we plan to analyze data collected from previous summers with an end goal of producing a paper which can be published.

In addition we will be writing blogs to keep track of what we have accomplished throughout the internship.
